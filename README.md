Noodel, short for *node model*, is a 4-way scroll-snap user interface for content trees that you can navigate by simply moving up, down, left and right. It offers a new way to present content that is clean, intuitive, and adaptable.

Noodel is currently available as Noodel.js, an open source JavaScript library for use in web projects. 

## [Demo / documentation](https://js.noodel.io/)

Noodel eats its own dog food: it uses itself to present its own docs ;)

## Browser support

Noodel is targeted to work on all major modern browsers.

Support for IE 10 and 11 is best-effort only - Noodel *should* work on these browsers, but there may be quirks and bugs in some features.

IE 9 and below are not supported.
